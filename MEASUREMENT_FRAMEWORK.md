## The 30-Day Business Case

After 30 days, build business case:

### Input Data:
- Disruptions handled: X
- Avg time saved per disruption: Y hours
- Cost per hour (manager salary): ₹Z
- Total time saved: X × Y hours
- Total cost saved: X × Y × Z

### Example Calculation:
```
Disruptions: 50
Time saved per disruption: 8.8 hours (14.2h → 5.4h)
Total time saved: 50 × 8.8 = 440 hours/month

Manager cost: ₹1,000/hour (loaded cost)
Cost saved: 440 × ₹1,000 = ₹4.4 lakhs/month

Annual savings: ₹4.4L × 12 = ₹52.8 lakhs/year

Ward cost: ₹8 lakhs/year (assumption)
Net savings: ₹44.8 lakhs/year
ROI: 5.6x
```

### Present to Leadership:
1. Show before/after table
2. Show time saved (hard data)
3. Show team satisfaction (soft data)
4. Show business case (ROI)
5. Recommend: Full rollout

## The Honest Conversation (If Results Are Mixed)

**If time saved is only 20%** (not 62%):
> "Ward saved 20% time in week 1. Not as much as we hoped, but still valuable. Let's understand why:
> - Were there unusual disruptions this week?
> - Is the team still learning Ward?
> - Are there friction points we can fix?
> 
> Let's continue for 2 more weeks. If still only 20%, we'll honestly assess if Ward is worth it."

**If adoption is 60%** (not 100%):
> "4 out of 5 disruptions went into Ward. That's good, but not great. Why didn't #5 go in?
> - Was it reported after hours?
> - Did the team forget?
> - Was WhatsApp just easier?
> 
> Let's fix the friction and aim for 80% next week."

## Bottom Line: Measure Everything

**The only way to prove value**: 
**Before Ward vs With Ward, measured honestly**

**If Ward saves time**: Data will show it  
**If Ward doesn't save time**: Data will show it

**Either way**: Truth is better than hope
