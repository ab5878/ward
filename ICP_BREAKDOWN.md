# Who Ward is For: ICP Breakdown

## ICP Breakdown (Markdown)

### Tier 1: Beachhead (Initial Target)

**Who they are:**
- Large importers/BCOs moving through major container ports (JNPT, Mundra, Chennai, etc.) with multi-lakh monthly D&D and detention exposure
- Freight forwarders and 3PLs coordinating customs, ICDs, CFS, and port legs
- Drayage and trucking fleets serving port, ICD, and park corridors

**What hurts them today:**
- Multi-lakh monthly demurrage, detention, and waiting charges
- Stuck between custodians, customs, carriers, warehouses, and customers when delays hit
- Unable to defend themselves beyond WhatsApp groups and phone calls
- Invoices paid because reconstructing credible dispute packets is slow, political, and demoralizing

**What tools they currently rely on:**
- WhatsApp for real-time incident reporting and coordination
- Phone calls for urgent escalations
- Scattered PDFs across port desks, CHAs, transporters, and warehouses
- TMS/WMS/PMS systems for the happy path (bookings, inventory, routes)
- Manual dispute packet assembly from chat histories and emails

**What changes for them when Ward is in place:**
- One-tap incident logging faster than WhatsApp, with tamper-evident proof
- Automated dispute packet generation in minutes instead of hours
- Clear attribution of delays (port-side, facility-side, transport-side, customer-side)
- Measurable uplift in % invoices contested and % waivers/discounts
- Reduction in internal blame games and "we don't know who to blame" escalations
- Ward becomes the default place to check "what happened" when invoices arrive

**Lighthouse configuration:**
- 3-5 customers with significant D&D exposure at 1-2 ports (e.g., JNPT + nearby ICDs/logistics parks, Mundra + CFSs)
- WhatsApp currently central to ops and dispute recollection
- Willing to run structured before/after experiments on dispute rates and outcomes

### Tier 2: Next Ring (Expansion Target)

**Who they are:**
- Domestic shippers (plants, DCs, retailers) with waiting time, loading delays, OTIF penalties, and chargebacks
- Warehouse marketplace and PMS/WMS platforms (ODWEN, Warehouse Now, AnySpaze, Xplent, IndoSpace/ESR parks, large 3PL campuses)

**What hurts them today:**
- OTIF penalties and chargebacks that hinge on "who delayed whom, when?"
- Loading delays and waiting time charges at warehouses and distribution centers
- No neutral, tamper-evident log of incidents and delays at their nodes
- Disputes with customers, carriers, and warehouse operators over delay attribution

**What tools they currently rely on:**
- WhatsApp for coordination between plants, DCs, and retailers
- Warehouse management systems (WMS) for inventory and space
- Warehouse marketplace platforms for bookings and availability
- Manual reconciliation of delays and penalties
- Email chains and phone calls for dispute resolution

**What changes for them when Ward is in place:**
- Clear timeline of delays across warehouse nodes and distribution centers
- Automated chargeback and cost allocation (which vendor, lane, site, or customer should eat which share)
- Scorecards for warehouses, carriers, and customers causing operational friction
- Distinction between structural delays (unavoidable physics) vs operational delays (controllable behaviors)
- Data feeds into contracts, pricing, and performance reviews

### Tier 3: Later (Future Expansion)

**Who they are:**
- Smaller importers and MSMEs with occasional D&D exposure
- Regional transporters and warehouse operators
- Customs brokers and CHAs looking to provide value-added services
- Insurance companies and banks requiring proof of delays for claims and financing

**What hurts them today:**
- Occasional but painful demurrage/detention charges
- Lack of systematic approach to dispute management
- Pressure from GST, e-way bills, banks, insurers, and auditors for provable evidence
- No scalable way to track and dispute charges across multiple shipments

**What tools they currently rely on:**
- WhatsApp and phone calls (same as larger players, but less systematic)
- Basic TMS or manual tracking
- Ad-hoc dispute processes
- Often just pay invoices due to lack of resources to dispute

**What changes for them when Ward is in place:**
- Affordable, scalable dispute management
- Automated incident capture without dedicated ops teams
- Standard dispute packet formats that work across ports and facilities
- Integration with existing TMS/WMS systems
- Access to Ward's learning from larger customers (which dispute formats work at which ports)

### In Founder Language

**Anyone in the India freight + warehouse stack who currently loses money in arguments because "it's not written anywhere except in a chat" is a Ward user.**

Ward sits horizontally across ports and warehouses, not inside a single WMS/PMS. We're the evidence layer that makes disputes winnable, regardless of which TMS, WMS, or marketplace platform you use.
