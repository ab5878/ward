  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of Ward v0 decision support system. All critical features validated: DISRUPTION FIRST hard gate working correctly (rejecting cases without disruption details), India-first context lock verified in AI responses, authentication flow functional, case creation with mandatory disruption fields working, AI decision generation producing structured 6-step decisions with India context (JNPT, CHA, Mumbai, INR, IST), section approval workflow operational, override handling with rationale capture working, audit trail recording all actions, and guardrails properly refusing out-of-scope requests.",
