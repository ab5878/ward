## Founder Narrative (300-500 words)

**What Ward Is**

Ward is the evidence layer for freight and warehouse-linked delays in India. A system of record for "what actually happened" when containers get stuck, trucks wait, and demurrage charges pile up. While TMS, WMS, and marketplace platforms digitize the happy path—what should happen—Ward preserves what actually happened when things went wrong. Built to be the only log that survives a fight.

**The Whitespace**

Here's the reality: India's freight and warehouse stack is digitizing fast. GST, e-way bills, TMS platforms track shipments, bookings, and inventory. The problem isn't lack of data. The problem is lack of provable evidence when money and blame are on the line.

When demurrage, detention, or waiting charges hit, the real system of record is still WhatsApp, phone calls, and scattered PDFs across port desks, CHAs, transporters, and warehouses. Disputes die in internal triage because reconstructing a credible packet across these channels is slow, political, and demoralizing. Many invoices are simply paid.

Everyone digitizes the happy path. Disputes still run on WhatsApp. That's the whitespace Ward fills.

**Who Cares Most and Why Now**

India is among the costliest regions globally for demurrage and detention. Major ports like JNPT, Mundra, and Chennai are in the global top tier for daily charges, with tariffs that escalate quickly after short free-time windows. Indian courts routinely uphold port and custodian rights to levy demurrage even when customs or agencies caused the delay—which means importers and intermediaries eat the bill unless they can show concrete, time-stamped proof.

Ward's initial beachhead: Large importers and BCOs with multi-lakh monthly D&D exposure. Freight forwarders and 3PLs stuck between custodians, customs, carriers, warehouses, and customers. Drayage and trucking fleets hit with waiting/detention charges but unable to defend themselves beyond WhatsApp groups and phone calls.

In founder language: Anyone in the India freight + warehouse stack who currently loses money in arguments because "it's not written anywhere except in a chat" is a Ward user.

**The Core Insight**

Belief under dispute is the product. WhatsApp wins at speed; Ward must win at settlement. We don't decide who's right. We preserve what was logged, when, where, and how strongly it's corroborated. Ward sits horizontally across ports and warehouses, not inside a single WMS or PMS. They know what should have happened; Ward preserves what actually got logged when things went wrong.
